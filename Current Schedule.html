  OPTION #1: IF CLIENT DOES NOT ATTEND SCHOOL
  Typically X wakes up in the morning at/around 6:00 AM and spends most of his/her day at a private/public day care setting, at his/her home, or at a relative/family friend’s home and usually goes to bed at/around 10:00 PM. X’s parents would like in-home ABA treatment services to begin in the morning/early afternoon and continue up until the time X goes to bed. Additionally, X would benefit from in-home ABA treatment services on the weekends, as this is normally the time when he/she displays excessive maladaptive behavioral challenges due to the naturally less structured schedule and routine of the weekend.

  OPTION #2: IF CLIENT DOES ATTEND SCHOOL
  During the regular school year, X typically wakes up in the morning at/around 6:00 AM, leaves his/her home for school at/around 7:00 AM; arrives at his/her home from school at/around 2:00 PM; and goes to bed at/around 10:00 PM. X’s parents would like in-home ABA treatment services to begin as soon as X arrives home from school in the afternoon and continue up until the time he/she goes to bed. Additionally, X would benefit from in-home ABA treatment services on the weekends, as this is normally the time when he/she displays excessive maladaptive behavioral challenges due to the naturally less structured schedule and routine of the weekend.
